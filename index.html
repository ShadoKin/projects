        <h2>Personal Facts</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan. I am currently 22 years old.
            I started coding when I was grade 11 and completely fell in love with it.
            I thought that BCIT would best teach me what I need to know to enter the IT industry.
            In the future, I hope to land a well paying job that is related to what I am currently learning.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I like archery, hiking, and eating.
